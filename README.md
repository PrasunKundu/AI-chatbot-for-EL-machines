# AI-chatbot-for-EL-machines
EEE final year Project about AI chatbot system for electrical machine to detects faults 
Problem Statement: Traditional fault detection systems struggle to 
process multi-sensor and large-scale historical datasets, leading to missed early 
warning signs and inaccurate fault classification due to inconsistent or incomplete 
information. 
Objectives: To design and develop an AI-powered chatbot system that can 
monitor, diagnose, and explain the health of power system equipment’s using 
real-time and historical sensor data. 
Methodologies: Project methodology includes the selection and installation 
of sensors and devices to capture real-time data, followed by preprocessing the 
data to detect the primary fault indicators. Then, AI and machine learning models 
are created and coupled with a natural language processing-based chatbot for 
interactive fault diagnosis and suggestions. Finally, testing and validation are 
conducted with an easy-to-use interface for efficient operator assistance and 
predictive maintenance. 
Significance/Novelty/Future scope: The project greatly improves 
electrical equipment’s fault detection through real-time, precise diagnosis and 
predictive maintenance, decreasing downtime and financial loss. It enhances 
operational performance and safety with interactive chatbot assistance to 
operators. Future prospects involve incorporating sophisticated AI models, 
increasing remote monitoring through IoT, and scaling to smart grid applications 
to transform power distribution systems.
